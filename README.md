This repository contains the code to extract suitable features from EEG data for classification of cognitive workload.

The steps to be followed to run the code:-

1. Download the Cognitive-Mental-workload-EEG-Data

2. Open the file Feature Extraction.ipynb

3. Run all the code in the notebook.

Note: Wait for a while after the code snippet with heading "Creating the feature vectors" is run to let the features get populated before normalizing the features. 

4. Then use these normalized features to train differnt classifiers in classification.ipynb
